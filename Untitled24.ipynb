    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats applications should use to request and exchange information. An example of API usage in real life is when a weather application fetches data from a weather service API to display current weather conditions and forecasts.\n",

    "Advantages of using API: Simplifies development, promotes modularity, enhances efficiency, enables third-party integration, and fosters innovation. Disadvantages: Security risks, backward compatibility challenges, reliance on external services, and potential performance issues.\n",

    "A Web API is an API specifically designed to be used over the internet through HTTP requests. It enables communication between different web-based systems. The main difference between API and Web API lies in their accessibility; APIs can be used for various forms of integration (not necessarily web-based), while Web APIs are specifically intended for web-based communication.\n",

    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two architectural styles for building web services. REST is based on standard HTTP methods, using URLs to interact with resources. SOAP relies on XML messages and can use various transport protocols. SOAP's shortcomings include complexity, larger message size, and slower performance compared to REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5. \n",
    "\n",
    "REST is lightweight, uses standard HTTP methods, and supports multiple data formats like JSON and XML. SOAP, on the other hand, requires XML messages and uses POST as its main method. REST is simpler to implement and offers better performance, while SOAP is more rigid and has higher overhead due to XML, making it less efficient for mobile and web applications."
